Now that he is allowed back on the ballot, Starbuck is up against a crowded field. The seat had been held by outgoing Democratic Rep.

The primary election is slated for Aug. 4. </p>   <p>After losing his place on the ballot, Starbuck quickly took the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/tennessee-gop-boots-trump-backed-morgan-ortagus-from-primary\" target=\"_blank\">party to court</a>, emphasizing that he met the alternative vouching requirement and amassed the necessary letters from party officials to earn a spot on the ballot.

Alongside Ortagus, Starbuck was considered one of the favorites heading into the race. He had garnered notoriety for his filmmaking career and has amassed a large social media following in conservative circles over the years. Ortagus remains banished from the ballot. </p>   <p>In a text message exchange involving a State Executive Committee official reviewed by the <i>Washington Examiner</i>, the official alleged that Starbuck's ouster from the ballot came from \"powers much greater than ours.\" </p>   <p>\"I'm sick to my stomach and I'm sad today.

Frank Niceley, a Republican, advanced legislation imposing a multiyear residency requirement to help his friend Beth Harwell, former chairwoman of the Tennessee GOP and former speaker of the state House who is also running for the 5th District's congressional seat.

Since the time Twitter’s board agreed to the offer, things have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/musk-suggests-new-twitter-purchase-price-be-based-on-number-of-real-accounts\">gotten complicated</a>, with the Tesla founder accusing the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/social-media\">social media</a> company of obfuscating the truth about how many fake or spam accounts operate on the platform. </p>   <p>The matter became even more contentious on Monday when Musk’s legal team submitted a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that reiterated his request for information about the percentage of spam bots, or nonusers, that comprise Twitter. </p>   <p>“Musk believes the company is actively resisting and thwarting his information rights (and the company's corresponding obligations) under the merger agreement,” the SEC filing reads. </p>   <p><b><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/musk-threatens-to-terminate-twitter-deal-if-spam-bot-data-not-provided\">MUSK THREATENS TO TERMINATE TWITTER DEAL IF SPAM BOT DATA NOT PROVIDED</a></b> </p>   <p>“This is a clear material breach of Twitter’s obligations under the merger agreement, and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,” Musk’s legal team added. </p>   <p>The threat of pulling out of the deal raises questions about how that process would go, including how much it could cost both sides. Included in the preliminary acquisition contract is a $1 billion reverse termination fee, meaning that Musk could be on the hook for a 10-figure payment. </p>   <p>Although, the reality of the situation is that Musk can’t just back out if he changes his mind on the acquisition and get off with just paying the fee, which would be manageable for someone worth nearly $220 billion as of Monday. </p>   <p>Paying the fee and walking away would only be applicable if there is a reason the purchase can’t go through due <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/13/elon-musk-cant-just-walk-away-from-twitter-deal-by-paying-1-billion.html\">to issues</a> such as third-party financing concerns or regulatory intermediation, according to CNBC. Musk would also be able to bail on the Twitter deal if he can prove the social media company misled him, a tack some say he appears to be pursuing. </p>   <p>Twitter’s stock has tumbled precipitously given the uncertainty surrounding the purchase and general turmoil in the stock market. Shares of Twitter are now trading at $39.56, well below Musk’s $54.20 per share offer, a 17.5% decline in the past month alone. </p>   <p>Should Musk try to back out of the deal, Twitter could sue him for billions of dollars for breach of contract.

Since the time Twitter’s board agreed to the offer, things have gotten complicated, with the Tesla founder accusing the social media company of obfuscating the truth about how many fake or spam accounts operate on the platform. \n   \nThe matter became even more contentious on Monday when Musk’s legal team submitted a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that reiterated his request for information about the percentage of spam bots, or nonusers, that comprise Twitter. \n   \n“Musk believes the company is actively resisting and thwarting his information rights (and the company's corresponding obligations) under the merger agreement,” the SEC filing reads. \n   \nMUSK THREATENS TO TERMINATE TWITTER DEAL IF SPAM BOT DATA NOT PROVIDED \n   \n“This is a clear material breach of Twitter’s obligations under the merger agreement, and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,” Musk’s legal team added. \n   \nThe threat of pulling out of the deal raises questions about how that process would go, including how much it could cost both sides. Included in the preliminary acquisition contract is a $1 billion reverse termination fee, meaning that Musk could be on the hook for a 10-figure payment. \n   \nAlthough, the reality of the situation is that Musk can’t just back out if he changes his mind on the acquisition and get off with just paying the fee, which would be manageable for someone worth nearly $220 billion as of Monday. \n   \nPaying the fee and walking away would only be applicable if there is a reason the purchase can’t go through due to issues such as third-party financing concerns or regulatory intermediation, according to CNBC. Musk would also be able to bail on the Twitter deal if he can prove the social media company misled him, a tack some say he appears to be pursuing. \n   \nTwitter’s stock has tumbled precipitously given the uncertainty surrounding the purchase and general turmoil in the stock market. Shares of Twitter are now trading at $39.56, well below Musk’s $54.20 per share offer, a 17.5% decline in the past month alone. \n   \nShould Musk try to back out of the deal, Twitter could sue him for billions of dollars for breach of contract.
