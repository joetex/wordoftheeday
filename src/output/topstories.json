The ages of the 11 other victims range from 17 to 69, and their conditions range from stable to critical. \n   \nLaw enforcement has asked the public to contact 215-686-TIPS or 215-686-3334 to report any information regarding the shooting. A $20,000 reward will be given to anyone who provides information that leads to an arrest, Outlaw said. \n   \nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, addressed the shooting in a social media post Sunday afternoon, expressing his sorrow for the victims and encouraging legislation for less gun violence. \n   \n\"My thoughts are with those injured and the loved ones left mourning,\" Wolf's statement read. \"Legislators: Enough gun violence. Enough deaths.

That trial is slated to start in October in Virginia. The prosecutor has obtained a single guilty plea, which came from former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who admitted to altering an email about a Trump campaign aide under government surveillance. \n   iFrame Object   \nDurham was appointed by then-Attorney General William Barr in 2019 to conduct the review of the Russia investigation. Although Durham left his role as U.S. attorney after the Trump administration ended, the Biden administration let the inquiry continue after Barr appointed him special counsel. The endeavor has been criticized by Democrats and some legal observers, who claim the inquiry is meant to undercut Robert Mueller's special investigation into ties between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia. \n   \nCritics have turned up the pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to pull the plug on the inquiry, especially after the Sussmann verdict, but Ratcliffe argued that Durham's team is \"winning the war.\" \n   \nRatcliffe, a former Republican congressman from Texas who oversaw the nation's 17 intelligence agencies in the latter part of the Trump administration, contended that testimony during the trial vindicated documents he declassified while in office. \n   \nIn making his point about expanded indictments, Ratcliffe said the \"most powerful\" testimony during the trial came from Robby Mook, the campaign manager for Clinton in 2016, who said the candidate personally signed off on sharing the Trump-Russia allegations related to Alfa-Bank with the media during the election. Ratcliffe also noted testimony from Marc Elias, the top lawyer for Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, about his role in pushing collusion claims.\n   \nThe Trump-Russia inquiry began in late July 2016 after Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos bragged to an Australian diplomat that he heard the Russians had damaging information on Clinton. The FBI's counterintelligence investigation, dubbed \"Crossfire Hurricane,\" was later wrapped into special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference. Mueller's team did find contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia but was unable to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump team and the Kremlin.\n   \nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n   \nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz determined there was sufficient cause for the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, but both Barr and Durham publicly disagreed with that conclusion in late 2019. \n   \nStanding by his statement more than two years ago, Barr said during a Fox News interview on Wednesday that Durham has \"accomplished something far more important\" than obtaining a conviction in the Sussmann case. \n   \n\"First, I think he crystallized the central role played by the Hillary campaign and launching as a dirty trick the whole Russiagate collusion narrative and fanning the flames of it,\" he said. \"And, second, I think he exposed really dreadful behavior by the supervisors in the FBI, the senior ranks of the FBI, who knowingly used this information to start an investigation of Trump and then duped their own agents by lying to them and refusing to tell them what the real source of that information was. And that was appalling.\"\n   \nEspousing a similar point of view, Ratcliffe on Sunday asserted there was a \"deliberate effort\" by certain federal law enforcement officials to \"mislead the American people for political reasons.\"\n                                                                            window.DY = window.DY || { }; DY.recommendationContext = { type: \"POST\", data: ['00000181-33e3-dedf-ad93-bfe3179d0000'] };                                                                                            © 2022 Washington Examiner","content":"Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe voiced confidence in special counsel John Durham after the prosecutor lost the high-profile case against Democratic cybersecurity lawyer Michael Sussmann.","contentSnippet":"Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe voiced confidence in special counsel John Durham after the prosecutor lost the high-profile case against Democratic cybersecurity lawyer Michael Sussmann.","guid":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/durham-is-winning-the-war-ratcliffe-expects-more-indictments-after-sussmann-trial","isoDate":"2022-06-05T15:42:47.000Z"},{"creator":"Heather Hamilton","title":"Gas prices soar near $10 in this part of the country","link":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/gas-prices-soar-near-10-in-this-part-of-the-country","pubDate":"Sun, 05 Jun 2022 14:36:08 GMT","author":"Heather Hamilton","content:encoded":"<html lang=\"en\" prefix=\"op: http://media.facebook.com/op#\">    <head>        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">        <meta property=\"op:markup_version\" content=\"v1.0\">                    <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/gas-prices-soar-near-10-in-this-part-of-the-country\">                        <meta property=\"fb:article_style\" content=\"default\">    </head>    <body>        <article>            <header>                                    <figure data-mode=\"aspect-fit\" data-feedback=\"fb:likes\">    <img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-05 at 10.10.45 AM.png\" src=\"https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a438031/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1926x648+0+128/resize/550x185!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4b%2F82%2Fe4765a824f209ac3566942aa0739%2Fscreen-shot-2022-06-05-at-10.10.45%20AM.png\" srcset=\"https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a438031/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1926x648+0+128/resize/550x185!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4b%2F82%2Fe4765a824f209ac3566942aa0739%2Fscreen-shot-2022-06-05-at-10.10.45%20AM.png 1x,https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3b74c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1926x648+0+128/resize/1100x370!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4b%2F82%2Fe4765a824f209ac3566942aa0739%2Fscreen-shot-2022-06-05-at-10.10.45%20AM.png 2x\" width=\"550\" height=\"185\">            <figcaption>            Highest recorded gas prices in Mendocino, California, June 4, 2022.            <cite>(KGO-TV)</cite>        </figcaption>    </figure>                                                    <h1>Gas prices soar near $10 in this part of the country</h1>                                                                    <address>    <a rel=\"author\" href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/heather-hamilton\">        Heather Hamilton    </a></address>                                                    <time class=\"op-published\" dateTime=\"June 05, 10:36 AM\">June 05, 10:36 AM</time>                                                    <time class=\"op-modified\" dateTime=\"June 05, 10:45 AM\">June 05, 10:45 AM</time>                                            </header>            Video Embed   <p><span class=\"ArticlePage-articleBody-firstLetter\">A</span>s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/gas-prices\">gas prices</a> hit <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/drivers-in-this-state-get-six-month-gas-tax-holiday-as-prices-hit-record-high\">record highs</a>, Northern <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/california\">California</a> drivers are paying almost $10 per gallon. </p>   <p>The national average for a gallon of gas rose three cents overnight to $4.85, marking <a href=\"https://gasprices.aaa.com/\">AAA’s</a> highest recorded average price.
