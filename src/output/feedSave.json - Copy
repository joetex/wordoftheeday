They're all young. It's a long time,\" Tindall said on the podcast The Good, The Bad & The Rugby. \"But as any parents know, you just do whatever needs to be done. Louis, he was just wanting to have fun. And my two [daughters] are always mischievous, so it's trying to keep a lid on. There were a lot of sweets out back though, so there was a real sugar high.\" \n       \nImages of the restless 4-year-old royal making faces at the duchess during the pageant became a talking point of the festivities among royal fans and commentators. Louis also cuddled up to his mother and sat on the laps of William and grandfather Prince Charles. \n        \nTindall's middle daughter, 3-year-old Lena, also attracted attention when she shared her snacks with William and Kate's other two children, Prince George, 8, and Princess Charlotte, 7. Tindall married the queen's granddaughter Zara in 2011 and has three children: Mia is the oldest at 8, Lena is the middle, and Lucas is 1. \n        \nWilliam said last year that spending time with the entire royal family is special because they are divided most of the time. \n   \n\"For me, generally, bringing the family together at Christmastime is always lovely because we're quite spread out doing our things a lot of time throughout the year. We get very few moments to actually come together,\" William said, according to People Magazine. \"When I see my children meet up with my cousin's children, and they all have a wonderful time playing together, it's very special.

Waltho lives in District F but had been appointed by Naft, who represents District A. </p>   <p>Naft asserted he moved to boot Waltho from her role because she has injected politics into the post. Waltho had been registered as an independent when he appointed her planning commissioner but became a Republican shortly before she announced her candidacy last September. All seven of the county’s commissioners are Democrats. </p>   <p>“From my view, I think she has tried to use that role politically, and that’s really where that had to end for me,” Naft said, <u><a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/clark-county/naft-plans-to-remove-colleagues-political-foe-from-board-2569046/\">according</a></u> to the <i>Las Vegas Review-Journal</i>. </p>   <p>Waltho’s term as planning commissioner, which makes recommendations on land use zoning policies, had been slated to last until January 2025.

Now, she is alleging similar knavery directed her way for daring to challenge her old boss’s colleague in an election. \n   \nDemocratic Clark County District A Commissioner Michael Naft appointed Waltho as his planning commissioner last year but successfully moved to oust her from the post last month after she informed him in September about her intent to run against his Democratic colleague, District F Commissioner Justin Jones. \n   \nLAS VEGAS WEDDING CHAPELS RECEIVE CEASE-AND-DESIST LETTERS FOR USING ELVIS IMPERSONATORS \n   \n“They wanted to make it hard for me and slow down my campaign,” she told the Washington Examiner. “But that's just not the case. It's not slowing me down. It's not keeping me quiet. If anything, it's the opposite. And I'm still a voice for the neighbors and [I still] go to town board meetings to be there to support them.” \n   \nClark County, home to Las Vegas and more than 2 million people, is the largest county in Nevada in terms of population. The county has a total of seven commissioners that oversee county government operations. Waltho lives in District F but had been appointed by Naft, who represents District A. \n   \nNaft asserted he moved to boot Waltho from her role because she has injected politics into the post. Waltho had been registered as an independent when he appointed her planning commissioner but became a Republican shortly before she announced her candidacy last September. All seven of the county’s commissioners are Democrats. \n   \n“From my view, I think she has tried to use that role politically, and that’s really where that had to end for me,” Naft said, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \n   \nWaltho’s term as planning commissioner, which makes recommendations on land use zoning policies, had been slated to last until January 2025. She was replaced by Liane Lee. Waltho said she is unaware of Lee having any prior land use or zoning experience.

And then we have a dustup at the Capitol, nothing burned down, and we're going to make that a major deal.\" \n    \nSuch action displays a double standard, according to Del Rio. \n   \n\"I just think it's kind of two standards, and if we apply the same standard and we're going to be reasonable with each other, let's have a discussion. That's all it was. Let's have a discussion,\" he added. \n   \nWhile Del Rio apologized for calling Jan. 6 a dustup, he did not appear to apologize for all the sentiments in his remarks. \n   \n\"I stand by my comments condemning violence in communities across the country. I say that while also expressing my support as an [American] citizen for peaceful protest in our country,\" he tweeted. \"I have fully support all peaceful protests in America. I love, respect, and support all my fellow coaches, players, and staff that I work with ad respect their views and opinions.\" \n   \nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER \n   \nThe Washington Examiner reached out to the Commanders for comment but did not receive a response.\n                                                                            window.DY = window.DY || { }; DY.recommendationContext = { type: \"POST\", data: ['00000181-44ff-d702-a3cf-4fff1bf90000'] };                                                                                            © 2022 Washington Examiner","content":"Washington Commanders defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio found himself apologizing after he called the Jan. 6 Capitol riot a \"dust-up\" Wednesday.","contentSnippet":"Washington Commanders defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio found himself apologizing after he called the Jan. 6 Capitol riot a \"dust-up\" Wednesday.","guid":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-commanders-coach-apologizes-after-calling-jan-6-a-dustup","isoDate":"2022-06-08T22:38:24.000Z"}],"feedUrl":"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/news.rss","paginationLinks":{"self":"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/news.rss"},"title":"News","description":"News","link":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/news","language":"en-US","lastBuildDate":"Thu, 09 Jun 2022 01:33:05 GMT"}}]
